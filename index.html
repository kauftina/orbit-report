    <p>I grew up in Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey – which is just 15 minutes from New York City.  I was raised in a large Italian family and I am the youngest of 9 children.

     We spent a lot of time in New York City and actually had class trips to the Museum of Natural History, the Statue of Liberty and many daytime Broadway shows.  We also went to Coney Island on a class trip in middle school!   In a certain area of Hasbrouck Heights you can actually see New York City in the distance.

<p>We also spent a lot of time on the Jersey shore.  My childhood friend’s family has a beautiful home right on the beach!

After graduating high school, I went to a small college in New Jersey, but decided it was too expensive and I wanted to transfer to a bigger university.  My brother-in-law had graduated from the University of Missouri and he convinced me that it was a great school and I should transfer there.  At the age of 20,  I moved to Columbia, MO!

 <p>About 6 months after moving to Columbia I met my future husband and we have been together ever since!  We were married in 1994.

   <p>After graduating I moved to St. Louis and worked for Monsanto Company.  
For a while we lived on Delmar Blvd in University City.  We had a lot of fun living so close to The Loop!  When we decided to have a family, we moved to Kirkwood, MO.
